INTRODUCTION TO Node.js
NODE JS is an open source JavaScript runtime for backend enviroments, it is used to develop backend functionalities for servers.  e.g if i want to ceck my data base every hour and email myself a list of all the new users i would use node.js along with something called Node-cron to do this. Most developers either use Node.js or python to develop their backend functionalities.
- Node.js provides a set of global objects and functions that are available throughout the application without the need for explicit declaration or importing . These glbals offer various functionalities related to the enviroment, process management, i/o operations, and more. Lets explore some of the commonly used Node.js globals along with examples.

- In the realm of modern web development, front-end components or functionalities are ubiquitous. Given that web browsers exclusively utilize JavaScript, these components are typically authored in the same language. The advantages of employing a uniform language for both front-end and back-end development are manifold. Firstly, it eliminates concerns about syntactical disparities between two languages, streamlining the development process. Examplse of sharing: shared library, custom function or algorithm,Data structure or object definitions.

Summary:
- Node.js enables the use of JavaScript for both back end and front end development, facilitating code sharing across components.
- JavaScript's dynamic nature allows its type to be determined by value, showcasing loose typing compared to strong typing.
- JavaScript seamlessly integrates with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation), simplifying data transfer between back end and front end without intricate conversions.
- While JavaScript offers numerous advantages, some may perceive its dynamic nature as a drawback in certain situations. Nonetheless, the ability to share code between back end and front end enhances the development experience for web applications.

  CALLBACKS AND ASYNCHRONOUS TASKS
  
SYNCHRONOUS TASK

- Synchronous processing requires tasks to be completed sequentially, leading to blocking where each task must finish before the next one begins.
- In contrast, asynchronous processing allows tasks to be executed concurrently, enabling the program to proceed to the next task without waiting for the previous one to finish.
- Synchronous processing can cause user interface responsiveness issues, such as a grayed-out screen during form submission, where the interface remains unresponsive until the synchronous background process completes.
- Asynchronous programming alleviates these issues by allowing the program to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, enhancing user experience and responsiveness.

- ASYNCHRONOUS TASKS

  Asynchronous tasks refer to operations or functions that do not block the execution of other code while they are being performed. Instead of waiting for an operation to complete before moving on to the next task, asynchronous tasks allow the program to continue executing other code while waiting for the asynchronous operation to finish. This approach improves the efficiency and responsiveness of programs, particularly in scenarios where certain operations may take time to complete, such as reading files from disk, making network requests, or processing large amounts of data.

Here's how asynchronous tasks work:

1. **Non-Blocking Execution**:
   - When an asynchronous task is initiated, the program does not wait for the task to finish before moving on to the next line of code.
   - Instead, the program continues executing other tasks or functions while the asynchronous task runs in the background.

2. **Callbacks or Promises**:
   - Asynchronous tasks in JavaScript are typically managed using callbacks, promises, or async/await syntax.
   - Callbacks are functions that are passed as arguments to asynchronous functions and are executed once the asynchronous operation completes.
   - Promises provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous operations, allowing developers to chain multiple asynchronous tasks together and handle success or failure conditions more effectively.

3. **Event-Driven Programming**:
   - Asynchronous tasks are often associated with event-driven programming, where tasks are triggered by events such as user input, timers, or external signals.
   - The program responds to events as they occur, initiating asynchronous tasks and handling their results asynchronously.

4. **Concurrency and Parallelism**:
   - Asynchronous tasks enable concurrency by allowing multiple tasks to be executed concurrently without blocking each other.
   - They also facilitate parallelism, where multiple tasks are executed simultaneously on multi-core processors, further improving performance.

5. **Common Use Cases**:
   - Asynchronous tasks are commonly used for I/O-bound operations such as reading files, making network requests, or querying databases.
   - They are also useful for handling user interactions in web applications, such as processing form submissions or updating the UI in response to user actions.

Overall, asynchronous tasks play a crucial role in modern programming, enabling developers to write efficient and responsive code that can handle complex operations without blocking the main thread of execution.

NO GLOBALS
CREATING A MODULE

Let's explore how modules operate within Node.js. Begin by creating a new file in Visual Studio Code, naming it "my-module.js." Simultaneously, initiate another file, "module-demo.js," where the objective is to make the code within "my-module.js" accessible. This exemplifies the potency of code reuse, such as employing a math library across different files or projects.
AN EXAMPLE: var myModule = require('./my-module.js')
console.log(myModule.myText)

Summary:

Node.js module loading system follows a simple one-to-one correspondence between files and modules. To access a module such as "my-module.js" from another file like "module-demo.js," you use the `require` function to set its reference to a variable. This allows you to access the functionality exported by the module.

For testing and verification purposes, you can use console logging to confirm that the values retrieved from the module match expectations. By executing the "module-demo.js" file in the console or terminal using the command `node module-demo`, you can observe the console log displaying the placeholder text "hello from module." This demonstrates successful data access in "module-demo.js" from another module or file, showcasing the extendable capability of accessing functionality across different modules or files within a Node.js application.

THIRD-PARTY PACKAGES:

Node.js introduces the Node Package Manager (NPM), a powerful tool for managing packages, which are collections of one or more modules. Leveraging third-party modules allows developers to access a wide range of pre-built functionality and tools to enhance their Node.js applications.

One widely used package is Lodash, which provides utility functions for common programming tasks. To utilize Lodash in a Node.js project, you can install it using NPM by running the command `npm install lodash` in your console or terminal. This command downloads the Lodash package and installs it into your project's `node_modules` directory.

After installing Lodash, you can access its functionality by importing it into your Node.js modules using the `require` function, just like you would with your own modules or other third-party modules.

Overall, leveraging third-party modules like Lodash through NPM significantly enhances the capabilities and productivity of Node.js developers by providing access to a vast ecosystem of pre-built functionality and tools.


1. **Using Lodash in a Node.js File**:
   - After installing Lodash using `npm install lodash`, create a new file named "demo.js."
   - Utilize the `require` function to import Lodash into your file and assign it to a variable commonly named "_".
   - Display the available functions provided by Lodash using `console.log`.
   - You can use Lodash functions like `random` to obtain a random number between one and one hundred, streamlining processes compared to plain JavaScript.
   - Save the file and test it with `node demo.js` to see a random value in the console.

2. **Installing Nodemon for Automatic Script Execution**:
   - Nodemon is an example of an NPM package that operates as a command-line interface.
   - Install Nodemon globally using the `-g` flag to ensure accessibility across projects: `npm install -g nodemon`.
   - Unlike regular packages, Nodemon does not appear in the local "node_modules" folder but is available globally.
   - Instead of using `node` to execute scripts, use `nodemon` to automatically restart scripts upon changes, enhancing development efficiency.

3. **Using package.json to Track Dependencies**:
   - When installing multiple third-party packages, it's essential to track dependencies.
   - The "package.json" file allows developers to maintain a list of installed packages and their dependencies for a project.
   - It provides a centralized location to manage project dependencies, facilitating package installation and version control.
   - Developers can use commands like `npm install` to install dependencies listed in "package.json" and `npm install <package-name>` to install specific packages and update "package.json" accordingly.

Overall, understanding how to use third-party packages, manage global installations, and track dependencies using the "package.json" file is essential for effective Node.js development and project management.

PACKAGE.JSON FILES

1. **Purpose of package.json Files**:
   - The package.json file maintains a list of project dependencies, making it easier for other developers to use and install all required packages.
   - It simplifies the process of managing dependencies by allowing developers to run `npm install`, which automatically installs everything listed in the package.json file.

2. **Creating package.json**:
   - To create a package.json file, navigate to the project directory in the terminal and run `npm init`.
   - Answer the prompted questions or use defaults to provide information about the project, such as name, version, description, entry point, test command, repository, keywords, author, and license.
   - Alternatively, you can use `npm init --yes` to quickly generate a package.json file with default values without being prompted for input.

3. **Content of package.json**:
   - Once generated, the package.json file includes the chosen defaults and scans the node_modules folder to add dependencies to the list.
   - It contains metadata about the project, such as name, version, description, author, license, and dependencies.
   - The dependencies section lists all required packages for the project, along with their versions.

4. **Benefits of Using package.json**:
   - Simplifies dependency management by providing a centralized list of project dependencies.
   - Enables other developers to quickly install all required packages using `npm install`.
   - Facilitates version control and dependency resolution, ensuring consistent and reliable development environments.

Overall, package.json files are essential for managing dependencies and project metadata in Node.js projects, streamlining the development process and enhancing project maintainability and collaboration.

NODE MODULES:
READING FROM FILES

To work with disk access and file operations in Node.js, you can utilize the built-in 'fs' module, which stands for "file system". Here's a summary of the steps to gain access to the file system in a Node.js application:

1. **Create a New File**: Start by creating a new JavaScript file in your project directory. For example, name it "demo.js".

2. **Require the 'fs' Module**: In the JavaScript file, use the `require` function to import the 'fs' module. This module provides functions for working with the file system, including reading from and writing to files, creating directories, and more.

3. **Accessing File System Functionality**: Once you've required the 'fs' module, you can access its various functions to perform file-related operations. For example, you can use functions like `fs.readFile`, `fs.writeFile`, `fs.existsSync`, etc., to read, write, and check the existence of files and directories.

By requiring the 'fs' module in your Node.js application, you gain access to powerful functionality for working with files and directories, enabling you to perform a wide range of disk access operations efficiently and effectively.

DEPENDENCIES ADDED:

Summary:

To perform file read operations in a Node.js application, you can use the built-in 'fs' module. Here's a summary of the steps involved:

1. **Create a Data File**: Start by generating a temporary JSON file named 'data.json'. Inside this file, create a JSON object with a property named 'name', using a placeholder value like 'Tim'.

2. **Require the 'fs' Module**: In your Node.js application file (e.g., 'demo.js'), require the 'fs' module using the `require` function. This module provides functions for working with the file system.

3. **Read from the File**: Use the `fs.readFile` function to read from the data JSON file. Pass the location of the file as the first parameter and provide a callback function as the second parameter.

4. **Callback Function**: Since the `fs.readFile` function is asynchronous, it accepts a callback function as the second parameter. This callback function is invoked once the file reading operation is complete. You can use either a separate named function, an anonymous function directly, or a concise arrow function as the callback.

By following these steps, you can effectively read data from a file in a Node.js application using the 'fs' module, allowing you to access and process file content asynchronously.


Summary:

In a Node.js application, there are alternative methods to access data from a JSON file:

1. **Using 'require' Directly**:
   - Create a variable (e.g., 'data') and set it to the result of requiring the JSON file using `require` with the path to the file.
   - This method directly loads the JSON file as an object, making its properties directly accessible.
   - For example:
     ```javascript
     const data = require('./data.json');
     console.log(data.name); // Accessing the 'name' property directly
     ```

2. **Using 'fs.readFile'**:
   - Use the `fs.readFile` function to read the JSON file asynchronously.
   - The file content is returned as a string rather than an object.
   - You need to parse the string to convert it into a JSON object using `JSON.parse`.
   - For example:
     ```javascript
     const fs = require('fs');
     fs.readFile('./data.json', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
         if (err) throw err;
         data = JSON.parse(data); // Convert string to JSON object
         console.log(data.name); // Accessing the 'name' property after parsing
     });
     ```

By comparing the two methods, you may observe differences in the type of data retrieved. Using 'require' directly loads the JSON file as an object, while 'fs.readFile' returns the file content as a string that needs to be parsed into a JSON object. It's essential to parse the data appropriately to ensure consistency in data handling.


DIRECTORY ACCESS: 

In Node.js, directory access refers to the ability to interact with directories (folders) on the file system. Node.js provides several built-in modules for performing directory-related operations, such as creating, reading, updating, and deleting directories. The primary module for directory access in Node.js is the `fs` (file system) module, which provides various methods for working with directories.

Here's how directory access works in Node.js:

1. **Require the fs Module**: Start by requiring the `fs` module in your Node.js application file using the `require` function:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
```

2. **Perform Directory Operations**:

   - **Creating Directories**: You can create directories using the `fs.mkdir` method:

     ```javascript
     fs.mkdir('/path/to/new/directory', (err) => {
         if (err) throw err;
         console.log('Directory created successfully');
     });
     ```

   - **Reading Directories**: To read the contents of a directory, use the `fs.readdir` method:

     ```javascript
     fs.readdir('/path/to/directory', (err, files) => {
         if (err) throw err;
         console.log('Files in directory:', files);
     });
     ```

   - **Updating Directories**: Node.js doesn't have a specific method for updating directories. You would typically perform updates by creating, renaming, moving, or deleting files within the directory.

   - **Deleting Directories**: You can delete directories using the `fs.rmdir` method:

     ```javascript
     fs.rmdir('/path/to/directory', (err) => {
         if (err) throw err;
         console.log('Directory deleted successfully');
     });
     ```

3. **Handle Errors**: When performing directory operations, it's essential to handle errors properly to ensure the robustness of your application. You can use callback functions to handle errors returned by directory methods.

4. **Permissions**: Ensure that your Node.js application has the necessary permissions to perform directory operations. Depending on the operating system and file system permissions, certain directory operations may fail if the application doesn't have sufficient privileges.

Overall, directory access in Node.js involves using the `fs` module to create, read, update, and delete directories, along with proper error handling and permissions management to ensure the reliability and security of your application's file system interactions.


WRITING FILES:

Summary:

To perform file writing operations in a Node.js application, you can use the built-in 'fs' module. Here's a summary of the steps involved:

1. **Create a New File**: Start by creating a new JavaScript file in your project directory. For example, name it "demo.js".

2. **Require the 'fs' Module**: In the JavaScript file, require the 'fs' module using the `require` function. This module provides functions for working with the file system.

3. **Write to the File**: Use the `fs.writeFile` function to write data to a file. Pass the file name as the first parameter and the data to be written as the second parameter.

4. **Data to Write**: Instead of directly specifying the data to be written, you can define a variable (e.g., 'data') as a JSON object. This object can include various properties and values.

5. **Pass Data Object**: Pass the data object as the second parameter to the `fs.writeFile` function. For example:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

const data = {
    name: 'Bob'
};

fs.writeFile('data.json', JSON.stringify(data), (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('File written successfully');
});
```

By following these steps, you can effectively write data to a file in a Node.js application using the 'fs' module, enabling you to save data persistently to the file system.


Executing the script with the command node demo.js generates a data.json file. However, upon inspection, the file content does not align with our expectations. This discrepancy arises because the writeFile function anticipates a string as the second parameter, not a JSON object. To address this, we convert our object to a string. While a manual approach involves enclosing everything in double quotes, a more efficient method is using JSON.stringify. This modification is made on line seven, resulting in the desired JSON format.



lthough the script functions correctly, a deprecation warning occurs, advising against calling an asynchronous function without a callback. Investigating further, we find that the writeFile function expects a callback as its third parameter. To resolve this, we create a callback function that logs any errors and a 'write finished' message to the console. The updated script eliminates the deprecation warning and provides feedback upon completion.

Now equipped with comprehensive knowledge of file system operations, our next step involves exploring popular web frameworks for Node.js.
